# AQUA · AITP — Aerospace Industry Transition Plan (v1)

> Execution-ready plan for aligning aerospace programs to the AQUA bridge (CB → QB → UE → FE → FWD → QS) and closing the climate credibility gap with verifiable governance, capex signals, and technology delivery.

* **Scope**: Applies to airlines, OEMs, and infrastructure partners integrating with the TFA stack and AQUA digital spine.
* **Audience**: Board-level transition sponsors, MAP owners, sustainability leads, and assurance teams.

---

## 0) Problem Statement — Why This Plan Exists

* >95% of firms publish climate policies, yet only ~10% achieve top-tier management quality; ~22% still fail basic disclosure tests. AITP delivers the missing execution system.
* Regulatory compass: **ICAO LTAG** (net-zero international aviation by 2050), **EU ReFuelEU** SAF mandates, and tightening **EU ETS** coverage.
* Plan goal: convert policy intent into governed data, funded technology bets, and auditable delivery milestones.

## 1) Governance & Disclosure (CB Layer — Data Truth)

| Objective | Minimum Within 12 Months | AQUA Hook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Policy & Scope | Board-approved climate policy, fiduciary linkage, Scopes 1–3, alignment to ICAO LTAG + CSRD/ISSB | CB schema baseline, QB verification templates |
| Targets | SBTi-aligned near-term (2030) + net-zero 2050; intensity + absolute; third-party validation preferred | CB target ledger, QS evidence bundle |
| Disclosure | Annual GHG inventory with methodology, assurance level, and activity data | UE packetization → FE regulator feeds |
| Capital Alignment | Publish capex/opex split by lever; tie executive compensation to delivery | FE treasury hooks, QS incentive state |

**Implementation flow**: `CB → QB` standardizes ledgers and trace controls → `UE` emits unit-evidence packets per flight/fuel/fleet event → `FE` federation registry exposes proofs to regulators, airports, and investors.

**Exit to TPI MQ-5**: Credible plan, capex alignment, board oversight, verifiable KPIs, public progress reporting anchored in QS.

## 2) Carbon Performance Pathway (UE → FE — Delivery Engine)

| Phase | 2025–2030 | 2030–2040 | 2040–2050 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operations & Fleet | 10–15% efficiency via routing, weight, CDA, taxi optimization; accelerated renewal (A321neo/787 class) | Continued fleet refresh aligned to new airframe concepts | Only high-efficiency fleets in service |
| SAF Ramp | Meet/beat ReFuelEU blend floors; report well-to-wake CI | Double-digit blends, hedged e-kerosene as ETS reinvestment lowers cost | SAF supports residuals only |
| Non-CO₂ | Launch contrail-avoidance trials, disclose impacts | Mature contrail management | Integrated climate impact minimization |
| Zero-Emission Tech | Seed funding for ZE demonstrators | Launch regional H₂-electric demos; certify BWB/H₂ concepts | ZE aircraft penetrates trunk routes |
| Residual Management | n/a | n/a | Durable removals for hard-to-abate remainder |

---

## 3) Technology Roadmap (FWD Layer — Option Value with Physics)

* **Short-term (Now)**: Operational analytics, lightweighting, retrofit kits (sharklets, riblets, laminar tech), predictive maintenance loops in CB/QB.
* **Medium (2030s)**: SAF dominance with rising e-fuel share, hybrid-electric for short-haul, maturing thermal management & cryogenic handling (CQH link).
* **Long (2040s)**: Hydrogen aircraft (gaseous/cryogenic) and blended-wing-body architectures on trunk routes, airport H₂ logistics with on-site electrolysis.

**Guardrail**: Protect ring-fenced capex for zero-emission aircraft and energy systems to avoid SAF-only lock-in.

---

## 4) Infrastructure & Policy Integration (FE Layer — System Coupling)

* Airports: SAF blending & quality chain, hydrogen cold-chain infrastructure, high-capacity electrification at gates/stands.
* Policy: ReFuelEU compliance, EU ETS exposure, CORSIA accounting; synchronize disclosures across FE federation registries.
* Supply Contracts: Volume- and CI-indexed SAF offtakes with step-down clauses when lifecycle CI drifts above contract spec.

---

## 5) Financing & Incentives (CB/FE — Numbers Meet Physics)

| Capex Allocation Guardrails | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| ≥60% | Proven near-term levers (fleet renewal, ops efficiency, SAF logistics) |
| ≥25% | Mid-term tech (H₂/elec/BWB demos, infrastructure) |
| ≤15% | Durable removals for residual emissions |

* Manage cost gap via EU ETS reinvestment mechanisms and public programs; disclose €/tCO₂e abatement by lever.

---

## 6) KPIs & Gates (CB → QB → UE Telemetry; QS Decisions)

**Quarterly Telemetry**

* Emissions: gCO₂/RPK and absolute tCO₂e (Scopes 1–3 separated).
* SAF: Blend %, lifecycle CI, cost premium €/tCO₂e.
* Fleet & Ops: Fuel burn per ASK, % new-generation aircraft, contrail-avoidance flight hours.
* Governance: TPI MQ level, assurance status, % executive compensation tied to plan.

**Stage Gates**

| Gate | Timing | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | 6 months | Publish policy & scopes, assured inventory, 2030/2050 targets, public capex linkage |
| G2 | 12–18 months | ReFuelEU-compliant SAF program live, airport infrastructure program approved, first H₂/elec demo funded |
| G3 | 36 months | >10% intensity reduction vs 2019 baseline with third-party verification |

---

## 7) Assurance & Anti-Greenwash (QS Layer — Truth Serum)

* Independent review of inventories and transition plan; publish TPI MQ scoring evidence bundles in QS.
* **Credibility Tests**:
  1. Capex disclosure matches pathway math.
  2. SAF claims backed by verified lifecycle CI and policy-grade accounting.
  3. Zero-emission aircraft program has funded line items, not slideware.
  4. Interim results reported even when off-track.

---

## 8) Implementation Timeline (From Day 0)

| Window | Key Moves | TFA Hooks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–90 Days | Stand up AQUA data spine (CB schema, QB controls), publish policy, start inventory & assurance, map ReFuelEU/ETS exposure | CB/QB activation, QS placeholder states |
| 3–12 Months | Sign SAF offtakes with CI clauses, launch ops-efficiency program, disclose capex reallocation, file TPI-ready progress | UE telemetry, FE regulator feeds |
| Years 2–3 | Fleet upgrades in service, airport infrastructure projects shovel-ready, H₂/elec demos operating, >10% intensity cut verified | FWD predictive loops, QS audited results |
| 2030 Checkpoint | Intensity cuts aligned to SBT trajectory, diversified SAF (incl. e-fuels), ZE aircraft roadmap locked | FE cross-domain alignment |
| 2050 Outcome | Residual emissions only, compliant with ICAO LTAG, net-zero with durable removals | QS terminal state |

---

## 9) Why This Works

AITP converts climate recognition into governed funding decisions, physics-backed technology pathways, and assurance-grade telemetry. It hardwires verification to prevent paper plans, SAF-only narratives, and silent target drops by embedding controls at each AQUA layer.

---

## 10) Artifacts & Next Steps

* **Controls YAML**: [`AQUA_AITP_controls.yaml`](./AQUA_AITP_controls.yaml) — load into CI to enforce gate readiness and evidence capture.
* **Integration**: Link stage-gate QS records to OPTIMO-DT and UTCS anchors for blockchain-backed audit trails.
* **Follow-on**: Extend with domain-specific implementation guides (e.g., MAP-PPP propulsion pathway, MAP-EEE electrification ledger).
