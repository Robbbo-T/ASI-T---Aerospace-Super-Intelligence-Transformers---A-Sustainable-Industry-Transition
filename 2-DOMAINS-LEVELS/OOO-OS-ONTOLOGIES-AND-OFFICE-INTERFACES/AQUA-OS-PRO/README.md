# AQUA OS PRO â€” Predictive Route Optimizer Application

## Overview
AQUA OS PRO is the Operating Systems layer application that performs predictive route optimization with a 10-minute receding horizon at cruise Mach, fusing live meteorology, aircraft twin dynamics, and quantum-classical sensing/compute.

## Target System
**Aircraft**: AMPEL360 BWB Q100 MSN 0001 Digital Twin Flight Test
**Study Case**: Madrid (LEMD) â†’ Naples (LIRN) route optimization (~814 nm)

## Architecture
The system implements a quantum-classical extensible bridge with these layers:
- **CB (Classical Bit)** â†’ **QB (Qubit)** â†’ **UE/FE (Elements)** â†’ **FWD (Wave Dynamics)** â†’ **QS (States)**

## Cross-Domain Integration
This application integrates requirements across all 15 TFA domains:
- AAA: Aerodynamic models and performance data
- AAP: Airport/terminal area constraints
- CCC: Cockpit interfaces and crew interaction
- CQH: Quantum sensor integration
- DDD: Data security and defense
- EDI: Electronic sensor systems
- EEE: Ecological optimization
- EER: Environmental data processing
- IIF: Infrastructure deployment
- IIS: AI/ML intelligence integration
- LCC: Communication protocols
- LIB: Blockchain ledger integration
- MMM: Mechanical system interfaces
- OOO: Operating system core (this domain)
- PPP: Propulsion system optimization
