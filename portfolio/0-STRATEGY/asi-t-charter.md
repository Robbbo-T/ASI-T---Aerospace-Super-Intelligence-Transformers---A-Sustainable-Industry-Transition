# ASI-T · Charter & Definition
**UTCS**: `utcs:asi-t:charter:doc:AT-0001:v1.0.0`  
**Owner / IP**: Amedeo Pelliccia (© 2024) — Licensed under AQUA-OS Enterprise  
**Status**: Proprietary methodology — federation-ready

## 1) Purpose
ASI-T (Aerospace Super-Intelligence Transformers) establishes a super-intelligent, transformer-driven ecosystem that optimizes aerospace design, operations, safety, and governance across aviation, space, and defense. It is natively integrated with the **TFA Architecture Core** and **Quantum Bridge** for CB/QB hybrid compute.

## 2) TFA Architecture Core (in scope)
1. **Trust Establishment** — identity, credentials, attestation.
2. **Data Security** — CIA, provenance, immutable DET anchors.
3. **Interoperability** — normalized interfaces & data models.
4. **Governance & Policy** — access, usage, compliance as code.
5. **DLT** — transparent, tamper-evident event records.

## 3) Pillars
- **Super-Intelligence Core** — aerospace-tuned LLMs/transformers; multimodal fusion; autonomous reasoning.
- **Digital Twin & Simulation** — high-fidelity twins; predictive analytics; scenario training.
- **Edge-Cloud Hybrid** — on-device transformers; cloud orchestration; **Quantum Bridge** readiness.
- **Human-AI Collaboration** — NL commanding, AR/VR, XAI for Level A–C contexts.

## 4) Applications (non-exhaustive)
- **Aviation** — co-pilot automation, traffic prediction, predictive maintenance, fuel/route optimization.
- **Space** — autonomous spacecraft, constellation ops, debris avoidance, ISRU analytics.
- **Defense** — UAV swarm coordination, multi-sensor threat detection, cyber hardening.

## 5) Technology Stack (representative)
AI: PyTorch/TensorFlow, custom aerospace transformers, RL  
Data: Kafka, Spark, Delta Lake (real-time)  
Edge: NVIDIA Jetson, ONNX, k8s at edge  
Cloud/Quantum: Hybrid cloud (AWS/Azure), Qiskit, annealing (where applicable)  
Security: Zero-trust, homomorphic encryption, DLT audit trails  
Compliance: DO-178C, CCSDS, ISO 27001 (mapped via CaC/CaaS)

## 6) Benefits
Safety ↑ (human-error incidents −90%*), Efficiency ↑ (fuel/maintenance −30–50%*), Innovation ↑ (faster R&D), Resilience ↑, Sustainability ↑  
\*Targets subject to program baselining and validation via DET evidence.

## 7) Risks & Mitigations
- **Data scarcity** → synthetic generation; federated learning.
- **Regulation** → early engagement (FAA/EASA/ICAO); sandbox trials; CaaS.
- **Security** → adversarial training; air-gapped partitions.
- **Ethics** → human-in-the-loop; ethics board; constrained autonomy envelopes.

## 8) Roadmap Alignment (high level)
- **Short (1–3y)** — predictive mx, flight optimization, AI constellations.
- **Mid (3–5y)** — autonomous cargo flights, Mars rover autonomy, quantum-assisted mechanics.
- **Long (5–10y)** — human-AI interplanetary ops, self-replicating infra.
