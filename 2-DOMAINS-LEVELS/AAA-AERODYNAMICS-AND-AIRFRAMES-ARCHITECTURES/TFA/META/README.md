# AAA — AERODYNAMICS-AND-AIRFRAMES-ARCHITECTURES

## Purpose & Scope
This META page captures domain-level decisions, authorship, and references for AAA. Scope: aerodynamic configuration, airframe architecture trade space, performance targets, and structural integration with other domains.

## Domain Steward
- Primary steward: [Team / Person Name]
- Contact: [email]

## Interfaces
- Upstream: 0-STRATEGY (requirements), 1-CAX-METHODOLOGY/CAD-DESIGN (MBSE models)
- Downstream: PPP (propulsion), CCC (cockpit/cabin interfaces), OPTIMO-DT (digital-thread ingest)
- Typical interface artifacts: SysML models, interface-control documents (ICD), integration matrices (SI layer)

## Compliance & Standards
- Applicable: EASA CS-25 / FAA Part 25, ARP4754A, DO-178C (avionics SW), DO-254 (FPGA/hardware), AS9100, S1000D for maintenance data.
- Certification notes: Track traceability in OPTIMO-DT and register deviations in this META.

## Variants & Notable Items
- Variant families: BWB-Q100, BWB-Q250, AMPEL360e
- Notable: blended-wing-body aeroforms, distributed propulsion structural interfaces

## Quantum Layers Map (local decisions)
- BITS/CB: host classical solvers & config bits (CFD parameters)
- QUBITS/QB: reserved for quantum-accelerated aero optimizers (QAOA/VQE prototypes)
- ELEMENTS/UE: canonical geometric unit elements
- ELEMENTS/FE: federation elements for cross-domain optimization (e.g., aero-structures coupling)
- WAVES/FWD: FWD models used for predictive gust response
- STATES/QS: no active QS artifacts yet — record experiments here

## Local Decisions / Deviations
- Local decision log: record deviation IDs, reasons, and approval dates here.
