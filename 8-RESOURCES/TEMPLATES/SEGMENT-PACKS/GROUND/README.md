# GROUND Segment Templates

Ground infrastructure templates for MRO, diagnostics, logistics, and safety systems.

## Focus Areas

- **MRO Operations**: Maintenance, repair, and overhaul workflows
- **Robotics Integration**: Diagnostics & MRO Robbbo-t systems
- **Logistics**: Supply chain, inventory, and parts management
- **Safety Systems**: Ground safety, hazard management, compliance

## Key Templates

- `mro-workflows.yaml` - Maintenance and repair process templates
- `robotics-integration.yaml` - Robbbo-t diagnostics and automation
- `logistics-coordination.yaml` - Supply chain and inventory management
- `safety-protocols.yaml` - Ground safety and hazard procedures

## Example Programs
