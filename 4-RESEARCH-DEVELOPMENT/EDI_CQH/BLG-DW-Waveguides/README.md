# BLG Domain Wall Waveguides

## Overview

Bilayer graphene (BLG) domain wall (DW) waveguides for tunable AB/BA domain-wall channels in reconfigurable 1D quantum systems. This project implements a model-to-hardware pipeline for co-designing DW width w, interlayer bias U, and magnetic field B to realize switchable 1D channels.

## Physics Model

### Continuum Dirac Model

The low-energy physics of bilayer graphene is described by a four-band Dirac Hamiltonian with interlayer coupling. For AB/BA domain walls, the system exhibits spatially varying stacking order that creates confined states at the boundary.

### Quick Design Scalings

Key parameter ranges for confined vs quasi-bound regimes:
- Domain wall width: w ‚àº 2‚Äì30 nm  
- Interlayer bias: U ‚àº 0‚Äì200 meV
- Magnetic field: B = 0‚Äì10 T

### Valley-Chern Physics

In gated BLG the valley Chern number per valley ùíû·µ• = ¬±1 (per spin) changes sign across the DW (total change |Œîùíû·µ•| = 2), predicting two co-propagating kink channels per valley in the smooth-wall limit; v‚ÇÉ splits their dispersions and modulates leakage.

## Fabrication & Transfer Notes

- Large-area graphene supply relies on CVD growth on catalytic metal foils with subsequent transfer to insulating stacks, following the scalable process established by Pandey et al. for wafer-scale films with low sheet resistance and minimal defect density (Appl. Phys. Lett. 96, 073102, 2010). Layer-by-layer assembly of such films enables deterministic bilayer stacks prior to AB/BA domain engineering.

## Simulation Framework

The transport simulation is implemented in `simulations/dw_transport.py` using the KWANT package for quantum transport calculations.
