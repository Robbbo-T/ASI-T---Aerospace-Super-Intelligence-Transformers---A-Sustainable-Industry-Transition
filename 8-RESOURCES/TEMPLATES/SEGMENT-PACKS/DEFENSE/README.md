# DEFENSE Segment Templates

Military and defense templates with enhanced security, compliance, and multi-organizational coordination.

## Focus Areas

- **Security Frameworks**: RMF/NIST/STIG compliance templates
- **Classification**: Boundary management and data handling
- **Multi-Org Operations**: Coalition and allied operations support
- **Mission Assurance**: Critical system redundancy and validation

## Key Templates

- `rmf-compliance.yaml` - Risk Management Framework configuration
- `classification-boundaries.yaml` - Data classification and handling
- `fe-policies.yaml` - Federation policies for multi-org operations
- `two-man-rule.yaml` - Critical action authorization templates

## Security Features

- **Two-man rule** enforcement for QB and FE high-impact actions
- **ROE (Rules of Engagement)** integration
- **Mission phase guards** with automatic policy transitions
- **Audit trail** requirements for all operations

## Federation (FE) Patterns

```yaml
# Defense FE configuration
defense_fe:
  multi_org_support: true
  coalition_ops: true
  data_sovereignty: enforced
  consensus_required: ["critical_ops", "classification_changes"]
  
  policy_frameworks:
    - RMF
    - NIST_800_53
    - STIG
    
  mission_phases:
    planning: {clearance_required: "SECRET", two_man_rule: false}
    execution: {clearance_required: "TOP_SECRET", two_man_rule: true}
    assessment: {clearance_required: "SECRET", two_man_rule: false}
```

## Compliance Checklists

- [ ] RMF authorization complete
- [ ] STIG compliance verified
- [ ] Classification boundaries defined
- [ ] Multi-org agreements in place
- [ ] Two-man rule procedures documented
- [ ] Audit logging configured

## Integration with Other Segments

DEFENSE templates can be layered on top of AIR, SPACE, or GROUND segments for military applications.
