# Cross-Domain Workflow: AAA-PPP Federation

This document describes how to orchestrate a workflow spanning the AAA (Aerodynamics) and PPP (Propulsion) domains using the quantum-classical bridge layers for collaborative computation without violating domain boundaries.

## Quantum-Classical Bridge Flow

The workflow follows the CB → QB → UE/FE → FWD → QS pattern:

### 1. Classical Inputs (CB - Classical Bits)
Both AAA and PPP domains start with their own classical data sources:
- **AAA**: Aerodynamic sensor readings, flight performance data
- **PPP**: Engine performance data, fuel consumption metrics

Each domain processes these inputs independently within their classical systems.

### 2. Quantum Preparation (QB - Qubits) 
Each domain transforms relevant data into quantum-ready information:
- **AAA**: Flight optimization problems encoded into qubits
- **PPP**: Fuel efficiency problems encoded into qubits

Quantum operations remain within each domain's scope at this stage.

### 3. Unit Elements & Federation (UE → FE)
- **UE Layer**: Each domain's Unit Elements encapsulate domain-specific quantum components
- **FE Layer**: Federation Entanglement coordinates cross-domain interaction
- **Entanglement Process**: FE synchronizes AAA's flight optimization qubit state with PPP's engine efficiency qubit state
- **Governance**: Federation follows consensus protocols defined in FE manifest

### 4. Future/Waves Analysis (FWD)
Cross-domain simulations using the entangled quantum state:
- Combined aerodynamics + propulsion effects analysis
- Hybrid quantum-classical optimization algorithms
- Future-state predictions for overall aircraft performance

### 5. Outcome as Quantum State (QS)
Final unified result:
- Optimized flight configuration encoded as quantum state
- Fuel schedule recommendations
- Performance predictions spanning both domains
- UTCS blockchain anchoring for audit trail

## Domain Separation Principles

Throughout this process:
- **Internal Processing**: Each domain handles CB, QB, and UE layers internally
- **Controlled Interface**: Only approved data shared at FE layer
- **Governance**: Federation rules enforce data sharing policies
- **Audit Trail**: QS outcomes recorded and blockchain-anchored
