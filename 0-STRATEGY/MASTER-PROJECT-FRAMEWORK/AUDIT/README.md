# Repository Audit Framework

> **Objective 1**: External validation that everything is organized, clear, and reproducible  
> **Success Criteria**: Green automated checks, published review guide, audit report in repository

---

## üéØ Purpose

Provide external auditors with comprehensive tools to validate that the TFA V2 portfolio is:
- **Organized**: Clear structure and navigation
- **Clear**: Understandable documentation and processes  
- **Reproducible**: Repeatable workflows without surprises

## üîç Audit Scope

### Technical Infrastructure
- [ ] TFA V2 architecture compliance across 15 domains
- [ ] Quantum-classical bridge implementation (CB/QB/UE/FE/FWD/QS)
- [ ] CI/CD validation system functionality
- [ ] UTCS blockchain integration and provenance

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] README.md completeness and clarity in all domains
- [ ] META documentation standards compliance  
- [ ] Process workflows and decision trees
- [ ] Code comments and architectural decisions (ADRs)

### Reproducibility Testing
- [ ] Build and deployment procedures
- [ ] Test suite execution and coverage
- [ ] Workflow automation validation
- [ ] External dependency management

## üìã Audit Process

### Phase 1: Automated Validation (30 min)
```bash
# Clone repository  
git clone https://github.com/Robbbo-T/PORTFOLIO.git
cd PORTFOLIO

# Run automated validation
make check              # TFA structure + quantum layers
make domains           # Domain status overview
make scaffold          # Verify scaffolding completeness

# Review CI status
gh workflow list       # GitHub Actions status
```

### Phase 2: Structure Review (60 min)
1. **Navigate** through [Portfolio Structure](../../../README.md#-repo-structure)
2. **Validate** each domain's TFA hierarchy
3. **Check** META documentation completeness
4. **Review** quantum-classical bridge implementation

### Phase 3: Process Validation (90 min)  
1. **Execute** end-to-end workflow examples
2. **Test** reproducibility of key processes
3. **Verify** documentation accuracy
4. **Assess** external usability

## üìä Automated Audit Reports

The CI system generates automatic audit reports stored in [`AUTOMATED-REPORTS/`](./AUTOMATED-REPORTS/):

### Daily Reports
- **Structure Validation**: TFA compliance across all domains  
- **Link Quality**: Internal/external link validation
- **Documentation Coverage**: META completeness metrics
- **CI Health**: Build and test status summary

### Weekly Reports  
- **Architecture Compliance**: Quantum bridge implementation status
- **Performance Metrics**: Build times, test coverage, deployment success
- **Documentation Drift**: Changes requiring review
- **External Integration**: UTCS, AQUA services status

### On-Demand Reports
```bash
# Generate comprehensive audit report
python3 scripts/generate_audit_report.py

# Quick domain status  
make domains

# Validation deep-dive
python3 services/aqua-os-pro/validation/aqua_pro_validator.py
```
