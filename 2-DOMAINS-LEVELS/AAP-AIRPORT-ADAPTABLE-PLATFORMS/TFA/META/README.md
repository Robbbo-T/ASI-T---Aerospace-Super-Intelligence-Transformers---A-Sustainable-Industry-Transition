# AAP — AIRPORT-ADAPTABLE-PLATFORMS

## Purpose & Scope
Scope: airport adaptability, ground operations interface, scalable platform integration for AMPEL360 and city systems.

## Domain Steward
- Primary steward: [Team / Person]
- Contact: [email]

## Interfaces
- Typical artifacts: station layout DWG, capacity YAML, resource allocation JSON
- Interfaces with: IIF (infrastructure), LIB (logistics), LCC (communications)

## Compliance & Standards
- Airport design standards, ICAO ground ops recommendations, local regulatory constraints, S1000D for ground ops maintenance

## Variants & Notable Items
- Urban micro-hubs, large-scale adaptables, rapid reconfiguration modes

## Quantum Layers Map
- CB: ground operations classical logic and scheduling
- QB: reserved for quantum-enabled scheduling optimizers
- UE/FE: federated elements to map airport ↔ aircraft interactions
- FWD: predictive passenger flow models
- QS: N/A (placeholder for future sensors-based quantum inference)

## Local Decisions / Links / Change log
- 2024-06-10: Initial draft created with domain scope, interfaces, compliance, and quantum layers map. Author: [Your Name or Team]
