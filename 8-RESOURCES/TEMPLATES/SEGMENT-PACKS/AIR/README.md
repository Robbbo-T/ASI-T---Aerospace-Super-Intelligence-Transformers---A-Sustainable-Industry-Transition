# AIR Segment Templates

Aerospace templates optimized for aircraft, aerodynamics, and propulsion systems.

## Focus Areas

- **Aerodynamics**: Wing design, airframe optimization, CFD integration
- **Propulsion**: Engine performance, emissions monitoring, efficiency KPIs  
- **Route Optimization**: Flight path planning, fuel optimization, weather integration
- **Operations**: Air traffic management, safety systems, maintenance

## Key Templates

- `route-optimization.yaml` - AQUA-OS PRO configuration for flight planning
- `emissions-tracking.yaml` - Environmental impact monitoring
- `propulsion-config.yaml` - Engine and power system templates
- `safety-checklist.md` - Aviation safety compliance

## Example Programs

- **AMPEL360 BWB-Q100**: Blended wing body with quantum-enhanced optimization
- **Sustainable Aviation**: Clean propulsion and route efficiency
