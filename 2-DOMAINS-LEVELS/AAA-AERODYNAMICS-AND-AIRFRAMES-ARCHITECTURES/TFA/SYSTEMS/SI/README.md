# SI · SYSTEM INTEGRATION (AAA)

Purpose: Define integration of aerodynamic subsystems with airframe structures and propulsion interfaces (e.g., aero–structure–prop coupling, control surfaces, high-lift systems).

**Artifacts:**
- `integration-spec.*` — Interface maps, integration plans, test matrices
- Traceability to: DI (cross-domain), SE (station constraints), FE (element models)

**Checklist:**
- Interface completeness (signals, loads, thermal, EMI/EMC)
- Validation plan (ground ↔ flight parity)
- Failure propagation analysis (FMEA/FMECA references)
