# DI · DOMAIN INTERFACE (AAA)

Purpose: Formal contracts between AAA and adjacent domains (e.g., LCC for control/comm, PPP for propulsion, EDI for avionics).

**Artifacts:**
- `interface-contract.*` — Typed, versioned interface definitions
- Compatibility tables (protocols, unit systems, safety constraints)
