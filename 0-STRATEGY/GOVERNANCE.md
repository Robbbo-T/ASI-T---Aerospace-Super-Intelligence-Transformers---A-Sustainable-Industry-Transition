## 1. Main Components of Pelliccia's Aerospace Governance Model

### Governance Philosophy
- **High-integrity, agile, auditable decision-making** grounded in **TFA** for discipline, traceability, and accountability
- End-to-end transparency from strategic vision to operational execution
- Continuous compliance as a foundational principle, not an afterthought

### Leadership & Organizational Structure
- **Chief Architect**: Overall system design authority and TFA compliance oversight
- **Chief Systems Officer**: Cross-domain integration and systems engineering leadership  
- **Chief Compliance Lead**: Regulatory alignment and certification strategy
- **Chief AI Officer**: AI governance, ethics, and model lifecycle management
- **Community Stewards**: Open collaboration and stakeholder engagement
- **Routine executive/advisory reviews**: Bi-annual governance assessments and continuous improvement

### Core Principles

#### Strict TFA Architecture
- **No flat LLCs**: All components must follow `2-DOMAINS-LEVELS/<DOMAIN>/TFA/<GROUP>/<LLC>/` structure
- **Domain traceability**: Every contribution mapped to specific domain threads
- **SYSTEMS**: SI (System Integration), SE (System Engineering), DI (Domain Integration)
- **COMPONENTS**: CE (Component Engineering), CC (Component Control), CI (Component Integration), CP (Component Production), CV (Component Verification)
- **ELEMENTS**: FE (Functional Elements)
- **STATES**: QS (Quality States)

#### Ethical AI
- Mandatory AI ethics checklists for all AI/ML implementations
- Review gates at key development milestones
- Explainability requirements for critical systems
- Regular validation and performance monitoring

#### Continuous Compliance
- **DO-178C, S1000D, ISO, MBSE** compliance as "compliance-as-code"
- **AMOReS** (Aerospace Modeling, Operations, Research, and Engineering Standards) pipelines
- Digital evidence pipelines for automated compliance validation
- Proactive compliance verification rather than reactive audits

#### Transparency & Auditability
- **Immutable logs** for all critical decisions and changes
- **DET** (Digital Evidence Trail) anchoring for provenance tracking
- Public governance documentation and versioning
- Stakeholder access to decision rationale and impact assessments

#### Open Collaboration
- **Modular OSS toolchains** supporting community contributions
- **Community engagement** through structured feedback mechanisms
- Clear contribution policies tied to strategic objectives
- Automated and manual review processes for all contributions

- **CAIO governance**: Centralized AI oversight and risk management
- **Model versioning**: Complete lifecycle management and rollback capabilities

#### Operational Security Risk
- **Zero-trust posture**: Comprehensive security architecture
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** adoption: Future-proof security measures
- **Routine vulnerability assessments**: Continuous security monitoring
- **Supply chain security**: End-to-end security validation

#### Market Adoption Risk
- **Structured stakeholder feedback**: Systematic market intelligence gathering
- **Agile/iterative deployments**: Responsive development approach
- **Community engagement**: Stakeholder involvement in development process
- **Value demonstration**: Clear ROI and benefit articulation

### Cyclical Risk Process
**Identify → Assess → Mitigate → Monitor → Respond → (Repeat)**
- Continuous risk monitoring and management
- Adaptive response based on changing conditions
- Lessons learned integration for continuous improvement
