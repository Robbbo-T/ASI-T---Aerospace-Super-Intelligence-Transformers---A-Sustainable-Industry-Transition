## Maintainer Note: AI Assistant Configuration

This repository includes comprehensive Copilot instructions to help AI assistants understand our TFA V2 architecture, quantum-classical bridge patterns, and governance models:

- **Primary Instructions**: [`.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Complete AI guidance for TFA architecture, AQUA/UTCS integration, and development standards
- **Test Suite**: [`.github/prompts/copilot-smoke.md`](.github/prompts/copilot-smoke.md) - Validation prompts to verify AI understanding
- **Terminology Enforcement**: Automated CI checks prevent deprecated terms like "Fine Element" (use "Federation Entanglement")

Contributors using AI assistants (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) should reference these resources to ensure AI-generated code and suggestions align with our architectural standards and pass CI validation.
