# MAL-CB (Classical Bit Service)

Shared Classical Bit service for deterministic compute, solvers, and control across all domains.

## Purpose

MAL-CB provides the bridge interface for classical computing operations that are shared across domains.

## Key Operations

- High-performance computing coordination
- Classical solver orchestration  
- Control system interfaces
- Deterministic computation services

## Configuration Template

```yaml
mal_cb:
  service_type: "classical_bit"
  compute_resources:
    hpc_clusters: ["cluster1", "cluster2"]
    solver_engines: ["python", "c", "rust"]
  runtime_config:
    rtos_support: true
    real_time_guarantees: "hard"
  
# Integration points
integration:
  quantum_bridge: "MAL-QB"
  federation: "MAL-FE"
  state_management: "MAL-QS"
```

## Usage

Copy this template to your domain and configure for specific classical computing needs.
