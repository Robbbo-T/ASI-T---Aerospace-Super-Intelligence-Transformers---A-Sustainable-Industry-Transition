# LCC â€” LINKAGES-CONTROL-AND-COMMUNICATIONS

## Purpose & Scope
Scope: network, control loops, comms stacks (satcom, ground links), link-layer resilience.

## Domain Steward
- Primary steward: [Team / Person]
- Contact: [email]

## Interfaces
- Cross-domain link tables, ICDs, latency & throughput SLAs

## Compliance & Standards
- Communications protocols, spectrum regulations, DO-278 (if applicable)

## Variants & Notable Items
- Low-latency datalinks, quantum key distribution trials

## Quantum Layers Map
- CB: classical comms management
- QB: QKD experiments, entanglement maps for secure links
- UE/FE: federated link elements across domains
- FWD: predictive link degradation waves
- QS: quantum state artifacts for QKD sessions
