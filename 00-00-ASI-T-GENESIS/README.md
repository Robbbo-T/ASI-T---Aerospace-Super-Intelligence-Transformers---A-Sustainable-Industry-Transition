# ASI-T Genesis - Foundational Components

The key ethical guardrails in the ASI-T Genesis module emphasize the following principles:

1. **Non-Negotiable Ethics and Human-on-the-Loop Control**  
   Ensures no autonomous actuation without operator checkpoints and immutable evidence hooks, enforcing human oversight in all critical decisions.

2. **Safety and Security as Hard Constraints**  
   Includes mandatory MAL-EEM (Malicious/Emergent Event Mitigation) checkpoint testing to detect and mitigate adversarial or malicious actions before any actuation.

3. **Immutable Evidence-Based Auditability**  
   All actions require persistent, immutable QS/UTCS (Quantum-Safe/Universal Technical Communication Standard) evidence blobs to enable traceability, forensic verification, and accountability.

4. **Quantum-Extensible Hooks for Future-Proofing**  
   Components must be ready for integration with quantum-resistant cryptography and quantum machine learning to protect against evolving threats.

5. **Strict Path and Structure Governance**  
   Canonical roots and a rigid path grammar are enforced to avoid unauthorized or unsafe structural changes.

6. **Ethics Embedded in Change Management**  
   Every change or contribution must produce detailed change notices with provenance, scope, and operator signoff, integrated into CI/CD quality gates.

Together, these guardrails support a rigorous governance framework balancing advanced capabilities with human-centered safety, ethics, and evidence requirements for trustworthy AI operation.[1][4][13]

# ASI-T Genesis Module

## Overview

The ASI-T Genesis module provides the foundational architecture and core principles for the ASI-T system. It defines the universal injection prompt (UIX) framework, ethical guardrails, quantum-extensible hooks, and deterministic evidence standards fundamental to all downstream components and services.

The Genesis layer establishes:
- Canonical directory structure and path grammar enforcement
- Non-negotiable ethics and human-on-the-loop guardrails
- Evidence-based auditability with immutable QS/UTCS blobs
- Quantum-safe identity, attestation, and anomaly scoring baselines
- Automated validation pipelines for post-base and stack modifications
- Change request conventions integrated with CI/CD quality gates

## Structure

This module contains:
- Core universal standards and templates for all ASI-T components
- Proof-of-concept baseline components (e.g., BasIC UE)
- Foundational schemas and contract definitions for layers and domains
- Guidelines and scripts for evidence generation and validation
- Metadata describing policy hashes, model SHA, data manifests, and operator IDs

## Getting Started

To work within the ASI-T ecosystem, familiarize yourself with:

1. The universal injection prompt specification
2. The canonical root directories and path grammar rules
3. The checkpoint system
4. QS/UTCS evidence anchoring and proof recording
5. The FCR: Follow-Up Chain Rules for regenerative artifact management

## Contributions

All contributions to the Genesis module must strictly adhere to the ASI-T ethics, empathy, evidence, and path grammar standards. Submit changes with complete change notices that include detailed scope, hashes, and operator signoff.

## Contact

For questions or support, reach out to the ASI-T core team or visit the project repository.
