# IIS — INTEGRATED-INTELLIGENCE-SOFTWARE

## Purpose & Scope
Scope: onboard & ground AI stacks, QIE (quantum inference engine), model orchestration, agent frameworks.

## Domain Steward
- Primary steward: [Team / Person]
- Contact: [email]

## Interfaces
- CAI (AI integration), DDD (security), OPTIMO-DT (model versioning)

## Compliance & Standards

## Variants & Notable Items
- AMPELLLM agent integrations, AGI-DT prototypes

## Quantum Layers Map
- CB: classical compute orchestrator
- QB: QNN experiments, QIE registry
- UE/FE: federation of models (FE → cross-domain model ensembles)
- FWD: predictive model waves for mission planning
- QS: state capture for hybrid classical-quantum models
