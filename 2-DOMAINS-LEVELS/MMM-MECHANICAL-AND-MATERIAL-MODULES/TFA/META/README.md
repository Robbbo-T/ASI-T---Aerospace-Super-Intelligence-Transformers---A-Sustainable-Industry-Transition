# MMM â€” MECHANICAL-AND-MATERIAL-MODULES

## Purpose & Scope
Scope: mechanical systems, materials, structural subsystems, fatigue and maintenance considerations.

## Domain Steward
- Primary steward: [Team / Person]
- Contact: [email]

## Interfaces
- AAA (airframe), CAE (simulation), CAS (sustainment)

## Compliance & Standards
- Materials standards, testing protocols, NADCAP where relevant

## Variants & Notable Items
- Composite layups, additive manufacturing variants

## Blockchain-Based Material Tracking (Graphene & CNTs)
- **Secure Ledger:** Each batch of advanced material (graphene nanoplatelets, carbon nanotubes, hybrid composites) receives a unique UTCS-MI v5.0 token that is hashed and immutably written to the governing blockchain (Ethereum mainnet or a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric network).
- **Authenticity & Provenance:**
  - *Production:* Manufacturers certify lots with processing parameters (temperature, catalyst, purity, defect density).
  - *Integration:* Aerospace suppliers bind the lot token to CI/CP codes in the TFA hierarchy for configuration traceability.
  - *End-of-life:* Recycling or disposal metadata closes the lifecycle loop and records circularity metrics.
- **Lifecycle Ledger Entry Template:**

  ```yaml
  material_token: UTCS-MI-53-GRA-CNT-2025-001
  batch_id: "CNT-BF200-A"
  producer: "NanoMatX GmbH"
  process: "CVD multi-wall CNT, 98% purity"
  integration_ref: "CP:BWB-STR-LOWER-SKIN-01"
  certification: "EN9100 / ISO 20400"
  lifecycle:
    - stage: production
      date: 2025-09-15
      hash: "0xabc123..."
    - stage: integration
      date: 2025-09-20
      linked_airframe: "AMPEL360-BWB-Q100 MSN001"
      hash: "0xdef456..."
    - stage: recycling
      date: 2045-03-10
      method: "solvolysis / CNT recovery"
      hash: "0xghi789..."
  ```
- **Supply Chain Transparency:** Regulatory auditors (EASA/FAA/REACH) can query the ledger for compliance, while OEMs and MROs verify batch authorization for continued airworthiness. Smart contracts enforce immutability for environmental and sustainability data.
- **Regulatory Tie-ins:** CS-25/DOA composite certification, REACH/RoHS substance compliance, and circularity KPIs linked to the EEE environmental remediation and circularity domain.

## Quantum Layers Map
- CB: FEA job orchestration
- QB: quantum acceleration for optimization (VQE/QAOA for topology)
- UE/FE: unit parts & federation for supply variation
- FWD: fatigue-wave predictive analytics
