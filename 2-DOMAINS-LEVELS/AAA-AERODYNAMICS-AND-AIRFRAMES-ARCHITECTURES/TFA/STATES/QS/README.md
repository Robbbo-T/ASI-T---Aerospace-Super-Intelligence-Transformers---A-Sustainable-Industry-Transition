# QS · QUANTUM STATE (AAA)

Purpose: Canonical descriptors for quantum-state representations used by advanced AAA analyses (e.g., quantum-inspired optimization, uncertainty propagation). **Meaning is verbatim: QUANTUM STATE.**

**Artifacts:**
- `quantum-state-schema.*` — State vector or density matrix metadata + measurement maps

Notes:
- Keep physics notation explicit (`|ψ⟩`, density matrices ρ).
- Provide classical mapping for toolchains consuming derived statistics.
