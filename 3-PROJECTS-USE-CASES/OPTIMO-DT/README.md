# OPTIMO-DT — Digital Thread (V10.0)

**Scope**: Cross-domain Digital Thread enabling traceable flow from requirements → design → simulation → production → sustainment.

## Structure
- O-ORGANIZATION · governance & assurance
- P-PROCESS · lifecycle processes as code
- T-TECHNICAL · reference architectures & adapters
  - SEGMENTS: AIR / SPACE / GROUND / DEFENSE / CROSS
- I-INSTRUCTION · AI/ML systems & model governance
- M-MACHINE-OPERATIONS · Digital Twin implementation
- config, docs, scripts, tests

## TFA Mapping
OPTIMO-DT consumes/produces artifacts that map to:
`2-DOMAINS-LEVELS/<DOMAIN>/TFA/{SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, ELEMENTS, STATES}`.
Traceability IDs: `DT:{SEG}:{LLC}:{YYYYMMDD}:{SEQ}`.

## Success KPIs
- Requirements coverage ≥ 98% (auto-traced)
- Compliance checks pass rate ≥ 95% on main
- Mean audit evidence build time ≤ 10 min
- Model drift alerts < 2/month; remediation < 72h
