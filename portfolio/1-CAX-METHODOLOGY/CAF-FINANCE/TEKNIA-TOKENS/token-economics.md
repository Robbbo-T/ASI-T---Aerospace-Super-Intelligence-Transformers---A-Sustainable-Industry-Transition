### Valuation Algorithm

```solidity
function calculateInnovationValue(InnovationMetrics memory metrics) public view returns (uint256) {
    // Core weighted score
    uint256 coreScore = (
        metrics.technicalScore * TECHNICAL_WEIGHT +
        metrics.marketPotential * MARKET_WEIGHT +
        metrics.implementationComplexity * COMPLEXITY_WEIGHT +
        metrics.ipStrength * IP_WEIGHT +
        metrics.teamCapability * TEAM_WEIGHT +
        metrics.competitiveAdvantage * COMPETITIVE_WEIGHT
    ) / 10000;
    
    // Time adjustment (36 month maximum)
    uint256 timeAdjustment = metrics.timeToMarket > 36 ? 5000 : 
        10000 - (metrics.timeToMarket * 5000 / 36);
    
    // Risk adjustment
    uint256 riskAdjustment = 10000 - (metrics.riskFactor * 5000 / 1000);
    
    // Final calculation
    uint256 baseValue = BASE_VALUATION * coreScore / 1000;
    return baseValue * timeAdjustment * riskAdjustment / 100000000;
}
