# ASI-T Genesis - Foundational Components
# ASI-T Genesis Module

## Overview

The ASI-T Genesis module provides the foundational architecture and core principles for the ASI-T system. It defines the universal injection prompt (UIX) framework, ethical guardrails, quantum-extensible hooks, and deterministic evidence standards fundamental to all downstream components and services.

The Genesis layer establishes:
- Canonical directory structure and path grammar enforcement
- Non-negotiable ethics and human-on-the-loop guardrails
- Evidence-based auditability with immutable QS/UTCS blobs
- Quantum-safe identity, attestation, and anomaly scoring baselines
- Automated validation pipelines for post-base and stack modifications
- Change request conventions integrated with CI/CD quality gates

## Structure

This module contains:
- Core universal standards and templates for all ASI-T components
- Proof-of-concept baseline components (e.g., BasIC UE)
- Foundational schemas and contract definitions for layers and domains
- Guidelines and scripts for evidence generation and validation
- Metadata describing policy hashes, model SHA, data manifests, and operator IDs

## Getting Started

To work within the ASI-T ecosystem, familiarize yourself with:

1. The universal injection prompt specification
2. The canonical root directories and path grammar rules
3. The checkpoint system
4. QS/UTCS evidence anchoring and proof recording
5. The FCR: Follow-Up Chain Rules for regenerative artifact management

## Contributions

All contributions to the Genesis module must strictly adhere to the ASI-T ethics, empathy, evidence, and path grammar standards. Submit changes with complete change notices that include detailed scope, hashes, and operator signoff.
