# Community Hub

This folder defines how we collaborate: participation rules, roles, decision-making, and moderation.  
**Scope:** all community interactions across issues, PRs, forums, and events.

## Quick Start
1. Read the [Community Charter](./COMMUNITY_CHARTER.md) and [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. Pick a task from the backlog (labels: `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, `area/community`).
3. Follow the [Onboarding guide](./ONBOARDING.md) for your first PR.
4. Larger proposals use the [RFC template](./RFC/0000-template.md).

## Decision Model
- **Default:** Lazy consensus (72h) in the related issue/PR.
- **Escalation:** Maintainer review → Steward vote (>⅔) → Chief Architect tie-break.
- Records live in `/7-GOVERNANCE/DECISIONS` (ADRs). Use label `decision-needed`.

## Roles (RACI)
Defined in [ROLES_RACI.yaml](./ROLES_RACI.yaml). Key roles: Member, Maintainer, Steward, Moderator, Chief Architect, Compliance Lead.

## Safety & Moderation
- Conduct: [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Enforcement: [MODERATION_POLICY.md](./MODERATION_POLICY.md)
- Report via `Community: Code of Conduct` issue template or email `governance@project.local`.

## TFA Alignment
All community work must respect **TFA-only** structure and reference domain threads in `2-DOMAINS-LEVELS/<DOMAIN>/TFA/...`.

## Labels
See [LABELS.md](./LABELS.md) for triage and workflow labels.
