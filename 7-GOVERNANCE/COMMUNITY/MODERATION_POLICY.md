# Moderation Policy

## Principles
Safety first · Evidence-based actions · Proportionality · Appeal rights · Privacy

## Process
1. **Intake:** capture reports (issue/email), acknowledge within 24h.
2. **Triage:** assess severity (S0–S3), check history, gather evidence.
3. **Action:** apply response ladder; document in private log.
4. **Notify:** inform parties; share appeal path.
5. **Review:** steward check within 7 days; record ADR if policy-impacting.

## Response Ladder
- Note → Verbal/Written Warning → Time-bound Restrictions → Removal/Ban
- **S0 (Critical safety/security):** Immediate restriction; post-incident review in 72h.

## Records
- Keep minimal facts, timestamps, decision, rationale. Store encrypted; limit access to Moderators + Compliance Lead.

## Appeals
Submit within 14 days; Steward panel decision (>⅔) is final.
