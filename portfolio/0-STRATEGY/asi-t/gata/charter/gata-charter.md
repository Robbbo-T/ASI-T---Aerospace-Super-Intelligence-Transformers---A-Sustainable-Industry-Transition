# gATA Charter: green Alternative Transport Aerospace

## Mission Statement

gATA (green Alternative Transport Aerospace) serves as the sustainability-first layer of the ASI-T ecosystem, mirroring classic ATA (Air Transport Association) chapters while adding comprehensive green aspects to aerospace operations, design, and lifecycle management.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Sustainability Integration**: Embed environmental considerations into every aerospace system and process
- **ATA Compatibility**: Maintain full compatibility with existing ATA chapter structures while extending them with green capabilities
- **Carbon Neutrality**: Support the aerospace industry's transition to net-zero emissions
- **Circular Economy**: Promote circular design principles in aerospace manufacturing and operations

### Technical Goals
- **Green ATA Chapters**: Implement sustainability-enhanced versions of standard ATA chapters
- **Lifecycle Assessment**: Integrate environmental impact assessment across all system components
- **Alternative Fuels**: Support hydrogen, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels), and electric propulsion systems
- **Waste Reduction**: Minimize material waste through optimized design and manufacturing processes

## Scope

### Domain Coverage
gATA integrates across all 15 ASI-T domains:
- AAA: Lightweight, recyclable airframe materials
- AAP: Green ground support and refueling infrastructure
- CCC: Eco-friendly cabin systems and waste management
- CQH: Hydrogen fuel systems and quantum optimization
- DDD: Sustainable data governance and integrity
- EDI: Energy-efficient avionics and sensors
- EEE: All-electric aircraft systems
- EER: Environmental compliance and emissions reduction
- IIF: Sustainable manufacturing and facilities
- IIS: AI-optimized eco-operations
- LCC: Green flight operations and communications
- LIB: Sustainable supply chain management
- MMM: Efficient mechanical systems
- OOO: Green governance and semantic frameworks
- PPP: Clean propulsion technologies

### ATA Chapter Extensions
- **Traditional ATA 70-79** (Propulsion): Enhanced with hybrid-electric, hydrogen, and SAF systems
- **Traditional ATA 50-59** (Structures): Extended with lightweight materials and recyclability
- **Traditional ATA 20-49** (Systems): Integrated with energy efficiency and environmental monitoring
- **Annex 16** (Environmental Protection): Full implementation of noise, emissions, and CO2 standards

## Governance

### Stewardship
- **Technical Lead**: Domain experts from EER (Environmental, Emissions & Remediation)
- **Domain Champions**: Sustainability leads from each of the 15 domains
- **Compliance Officer**: Regulatory compliance specialist for aviation environmental standards

### Decision Authority
- **Green Standards**: Environmental and sustainability requirements take precedence in design decisions
- **ATA Compatibility**: All gATA implementations must maintain backward compatibility with standard ATA
- **Innovation Balance**: New technologies must demonstrate both technical feasibility and environmental benefit

## Implementation Framework

### TFA Integration
gATA follows the standard TFA (Transformative Functional Architecture) structure:
- **Systems/DI**: Green API contracts and sustainability interfaces
- **Components/CV**: Environmental monitoring components
- **Bits/CB**: Eco-efficiency algorithms
- **Qubits/QB**: Quantum optimization for sustainability
- **Elements/UE**: Green unit elements and federation
- **Waves/FWD**: Environmental impact forecasting
- **States/QS**: Sustainability state management

### CAx Integration
Full lifecycle support through CAx phases:
- **CAD-Design**: Eco-design principles and tools
- **CAE-Engineering**: Environmental impact analysis
- **CAI-AI Integration**: AI-driven sustainability optimization
- **CAT-Testing**: Environmental compliance testing
- **CAV-Verification**: Green certification processes
