# TeknIA Tokenomics Metrics

This directory contains automated tokenomics simulation reports and metrics generated by the weekly CI workflows.

## Generated Reports

### Weekly Simulation Reports
- `latest_tokenomics_report.md` - Most recent simulation results
- `tokenomics_report_sim_*.md` - Historical simulation reports

### Simulation Artifacts
Weekly CI runs generate the following artifacts:
- Innovation valuation analysis with portfolio metrics
- Monte Carlo risk assessment with confidence intervals
- Token distribution projections and scenarios
- Governance metrics and participation analysis

### Report Structure

Each report includes:
- **Innovation Portfolio Analysis**: Technical score distributions, market potential, time to market impacts
- **Monte Carlo Risk Assessment**: Value at Risk (VaR), expected returns, sensitivity analysis
- **Token Economics**: Distribution models, inflation projections, governance participation
- **Domain Breakdown**: Performance by aerospace domain (AAA, CQH, IIS, etc.)

## Automation

Reports are generated automatically via:
- `.github/workflows/tokenomics-simulation.yml` - Weekly scheduled runs
- Triggered on-demand via workflow dispatch
- Results archived as GitHub Actions artifacts
- Key metrics committed to this directory

## Usage

### Viewing Latest Results
```bash
# View latest simulation report
cat docs/metrics/tokenomics/latest_tokenomics_report.md
```

### Running Manual Simulation
```bash
# Trigger simulation workflow
gh workflow run tokenomics-simulation.yml -f simulation_type=full -f market_scenario=base
```

### Accessing Detailed Data
Detailed simulation data (CSV files, visualizations) are available as artifacts in the GitHub Actions workflow runs.
