      note: "Keep this file as the canonical mapping for validators and templates."
  - validator_requirements:
      - "Validators must reference this canonical file for enforcement."
      - "CI validators should reject forbidden legacy labels and optionally warn for deprecated aliases."
  - migration_note:
      - "FE canonical name was updated to 'FEDERATION ENTANGLEMENT' to emphasize quantum semantics."
      - "For backwards compatibility, 'Federation Element' is accepted as a deprecated alias until deprecation window ends."
      - "Run `make check` and CI validators after updating labels."
